## Situation:
The group has been asked to develop software to score bowling games.
The hardware team is working on integrating with the pinsetter. The graphics team is
hard at work on some cheesy 3D animations.
The dev team has decided to split up the work. Alice will be working on a module that
counts up the pins knocked down in the individual rolls and indicates fouls, splits, etc.
Bob will be working on displaying the scorecard.

## Your Task:
You've been asked to write a calculator to sum an individual player's rolls
and return their score for each frame. The method should accept an array of rolls.
Possible values include zero through nine, a "/" indicating a spare, and an "X"
indicating a strike. The return value should be an array of scores for the frames the
player has bowled.
## Scoring:
The scoring method will be used to calculate a player's running score during
the game, so it's important that the method works for games in progress. For example,
[4, 5, "X", 8] should return [9, nil, nil], since the second and third frames can't be
calculated yet. When the second roll of the third frame comes in, all three frames
should be returned, e.g. [4, 5, "X", 8, 1] would return [9, 19, 9]. (Note that these are
the scores for the frames, not the running score).
